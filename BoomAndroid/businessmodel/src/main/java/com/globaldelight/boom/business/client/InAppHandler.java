		 * WARNING: Locally generating a random string when starting a purchase
		 * and verifying it here might seem like a good approach, but this will
		 * fail in the case where the user purchases an item on one device and
		 * then uses your app on a different device, because on the other device
		 * you will not have access to the random string you originally
		 * generated.
		 *
		 * So a good developer payload has these characteristics:
		 *
		 * 1. If two different users purchase an item, the payload is different
		 * between them, so that one user's purchase can't be replayed to
		 * another user.
		 *
		 * 2. The payload must be such that you can verify it even when the app
		 * wasn't the one who initiated the purchase flow (so that items
		 * purchased by the user on one device work on other devices owned by
		 * the user).
		 *
		 * Using your own server to store and verify developer payloads across
		 * app installations is recommended.
